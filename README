README for Yahtzee 2.1
----------------------

This is a complete reimplementation of the Yahtzee 1.0 that was
released on comp.sources.games in 1988.  This version has
slightly smarter heurisitics, runs faster, but most importantly
now implements the 100 point yahtzee bonus rule.

The game has been alpha and beta tested, and as a result a
few minor bugs were fixed and a couple of suggestions implemented;
thanks especially to Dean Reece, Andrew Sharpe and Ron Record.

The program was developed under Xenix 2.3 on a '386 box using
both System 5.3.2 and BSD curses libraries.  It should compile
and run on almost any System 5 or BSD system with a curses library.
It has been ported to SunOS 3.5 and an AT&T 3b2 running System 5.3.2.

Please edit the Makefile to ensure the program is compiled with
a valid high-score file name.  This can be overridden at runtime
by setting the YAHTZEE_HS environment variable.

Yahtzee attempts to determine its environment as it compiles.  If it
is getting this wrong then edit port.h and force it to recognise
SYS5_2_CURSES, BSD_CURSES or SYS5_3_CURSES.
